## How to update the types

The exported components depends heavily on the types defined in the
`@atlassian/forge-ui-types` package, but since the `@atlassian/forge-ui-types`
is private, we copy over all of the type definitions into the `types` folder
instead.

To get the latest type definitions, follow these steps:

- Change the version of `@atlassian/forge-ui-types` in `package.json` in the
  root of the repository.
- Run `bolt && yarn build`.

The types from the new version of `@atlassian/forge-ui-types@VERSION` should now
be in the `packages/forge-ui/src/types` folder.
